Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities. They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages.   It should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and non-food production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group ""crops"" and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group ""livestock products"".

Instead, we estimate TFP by using a Cobb-Douglas specification Y=AK^? L^? where: Y is real output; A is a scalar; L is a measure of the flow of labor input; K is a measure of the flow of capital input. The parameters ? and ? will indicate if the production function operates in constant, decreasing or increasing returns to scale. By assuming a Cobb-Douglas production function, TFP can be derived as follows (McCloskey, 1972): TFP=A=Y/(K^? L^?). By transforming the above equation into log linear form, the parameters can be estimated by simple least squares. In particular, the above equation is linearized as follows: In Y = In A + ? In K + ? In L . Cobb-Douglas type production function equations are appropriate for the functional analysis intended for the agricultural activities (McCloskey, 1972; Fleisher and Yunhua, 1992). In addition, it is preferred since it provides easy calculation, ability to test production flexibilities statistically and to obtain sufficient number of degree of freedom even where data is very few etc. The model used in this study is given in Eq. 5, which is the revised form of conventional Cobb-Douglas production function in order to estimate TFP. In our dataset, output is Agricultural Gross Production Value (constant 2004-2006 million US$) (USD), inputs are divided in three sub-categories: (1) Total economically active population in Agriculture ; (2) Permanent meadows and pastures; Arable Land; Permanent Crops (3) Livestock: Cattle, Sheep, Pigs, Poultry.
